Hello people 👋!

Curated directories are very popular on Product Hunt, it started with the lengendary Startup Stash, followed by Marketing Stack and hundreds of others. I myself built 3 curated directory of resources, and my last one, Undesign, is very useful (I use it myself almost everyday) and got pretty popular. 

Some people have asked me how to build a clone of Undesign, some of them without coding knowledge. Therefore I decided to turn it to an <strong>easy to use template for coders</strong>, and also I went even further by making <strong>it usable without writing a single line of code using Netlify CMS, that provides an admin panel to add / edit the content of the website for no-coders</strong>. 

<strong>CuratedStack is made for no-coders and coders, it's open source and it's free 🙌</strong>

<strong>Why would I need to build a curated directory?</strong>
- To build the next best Product Hunt project
- To gather all your favorites websites in one place and be able to share them with your friends
- To gather all the tools that your company uses for your new employees so they don't get lost
- To showcase your products in one place
- To make the world a better place

<strong>Last but not least this templates comes with some out of the box features:</strong>
- 🙅🏻 No-code friendly using Netlify CMS
- 🦸 Admin panel with Netlify CMS
- 🔎 Search bar
- 🌓 Automatic dark theme
- 🚀 Floating Prompt (for Product Hunt or anything else)
- 📈 Google Analytics
- 📊 Script to analyze your links & categories
- 💠 Script to download websites' logos automatically
- ✨ Static generation (free to host)
